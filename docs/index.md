# _Introduction_

Eiffel Intelligence is a service that aggregates informations from different events of a flow with the purpose of notifying subscribers when content of interest has been collected from desired events. By flow we mean a chain of Eiffel events that are linked together directly or indirectly. Eiffel Intelligence uses a set of rules to define what information will be extracted from an Eiffel event in the flow and at what location to store this information in the aggregated object.
